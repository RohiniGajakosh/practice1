This document captures a real-world series of Git-related issues encountered during cloning, committing, and pushing to a **GitLab** repository with enforced **pre-receive hooks** and **filename restrictions**.

It provides:
- ✅ Error messages
- 📌 Causes
- 🔧 Fixes
- 💬 Explanations

## 🧭 Cloning Repository with Authentication

```

git clone https\://<username>:<PAT>@gitlab.com/<org>/<repo>.git

```

### ❌ Error:

```

error: chmod on .../.git/config.lock failed: Operation not permitted
fatal: could not set 'core.filemode' to 'false'

````

### 📌 Cause:
You're cloning into a **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** mount path where file permissions are restricted (`/mnt/c/...`).

### 🔧 Fix:
- Clone into your **Linux home directory** (e.g., `~/projects/`) instead.
- Or use `core.filemode=false` in `.git/config` if the clone completed:
  ```bash
  git config core.filemode false
````

## 📂 Creating a New Branch

```
git checkout -b raj
```

### ❌ Error:

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /mnt)
```

### 📌 Cause:

You're not inside a cloned Git repository.

### 🔧 Fix:

Run the command from inside the cloned repo folder:

```bash
cd <your-repo-folder>
git checkout -b raj
```

## 📤 Pushing to GitLab — Pre-Receive Hook Blocked

```
git push -u origin raj
```

### ❌ Error:

```
remote: GitLab: File name custom_code/.../grpc-core-1600.jar was prohibited by the pattern "core.*".
```

### 📌 Cause:

The `.jar` file name (`grpc-core-1600.jar`) matched a banned pattern (`core.*`) on GitLab.

### 🔧 Fix:

You must **completely remove the file from Git history**, not just `.gitignore` or `git rm`.

---

## ✅ Attempted Fixes (and why they failed)

### 1. `.gitignore` addition (ineffective):

```bash
echo "custom_code/.../grpc-core-1600.jar" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Ignore jar"
```

🚫 Still failed to push — because `.gitignore` only prevents **future** additions, not existing history.

---

### 2. `git rm` + commit (also failed):

```bash
git rm custom_code/.../grpc-core-1600.jar
git commit -m "Remove jar"
git push
```

🚫 GitLab still blocked the push — file existed **somewhere in old commits**.

---

## 🔥 Solution: Clean Git History

### 🧹 Option A: `git filter-branch` (you used this!)

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \\
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch custom_code/.../grpc-core-1600.jar" \\
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

git push origin raj --force
```

### ⚠️ Warning:

This rewrites commit history. Always notify teammates!

---

## 🧼 Option B (Recommended): `git filter-repo`

```bash
# Fresh clone first:
git clone https://gitlab.com/<org>/<repo>.git
cd repo

# Remove file from history:
git filter-repo --path custom_code/.../grpc-core-1600.jar --invert-paths

# Push cleaned repo:
git push origin raj --force
```

> 🧠 `git filter-repo` is faster, more robust, and safer than `filter-branch`. Install with:
>
> ```bash
> pip install git-filter-repo
> ```

| Push code       | `git push`                       | filename blocked            | Use `git filter-repo` to clean         |

| Clean history   | `filter-branch` or `filter-repo` | Rewrites commit history     | Use with care and `--force` push       |

## 💡 Tips

* Never commit **banned** or **sensitive** files (use `.gitignore`)
* Use `filter-repo` over `filter-branch` for cleaning history
* Always test on a **branch**, not `main` or `master`
* Communicate with team before force-pushing rewritten branches
